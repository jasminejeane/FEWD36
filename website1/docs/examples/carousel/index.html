A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow. Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based).

          <h3>10 Developer Job Interview Tips To Land The Best Job You Can</h3>
          <p>There isn’t a large amount of advice out there on developer job interviews.

I’ve found that many talented developers have difficulty with job interviews, because they spend more of their time focusing on what they are truly passionate about, technology and development, and not much time prepping their interview skills.

It’s unfortunate, because having good job interview skills can really help you advance your career by giving you opportunities you wouldn’t be able to get without being skilled in this area. <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/03/24/10-developer-job-interview-tips-to-land-the-best-job-you-can/">continue reading...</a></p>

          <h3>Solving Problems, Breaking it Down</h3>
          <p>When most programmers are given a programming problem in an interview, they make several key mistakes.  The most severe of those is the improper allocation of time.

If you have heard the saying “measure twice and cut once,” then you are probably familiar with the idea of spending upfront time to make sure something is done right, rather than diving right in.

The most common mistake I see when conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible.

You must resist this urge.

You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.

Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.  Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.<a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2011/01/08/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/">continue reading...</a></p>
