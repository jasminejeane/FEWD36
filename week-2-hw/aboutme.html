<h2>About Me</h2>

<img src="aboutme.jpg" alt="Stunning image of Jasmine Martin">


<p><span class="fill">Well</span> there is alot I can say about myself. The good the bad.. the past the present. All of these elements have contributed to me wanting to become a programmer.</p>
<p>I guess I will just share the basics. I am a 31 year old African-American <span class="fill">rockstar!</span> I have graduated college (that 2 year graduation thing). I completed beauty school with Paul Mitchell. I've worked side by side with some incredible <span class="fill">Beverly Hills</span> Hair Stylist and worked for some interesting companies in my few years of living. </p>

<p>I have <span class="fill">4</span> brothers and sisters on my mom's side and <span class="fill">5</span> brothers and sisters on my dad side. I was born and raised in Oakland, CA but I have moved around a bit (Atlanta, Los Angeles and Portland). My favorite place to live is the Bay Area!</p>

<p>My favorite color is purple, my favorite singer is Beyonce, my favorite holiday is Thanksgiving, last but not least my favorite day of the week is <span class="fill">today!</span> :)</p>

<p>Thank you for reading my About Me I hope you enjoyed it!</p>
